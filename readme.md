<h1>Welcome to my readme for the News API Formative</h1>
<p>This is an app that uses a news API to create a single page web application that shows different news stories</p>
<p>The app will be able to filter popular news articles, by article type and will be styled to look like a funky news website</p>

- Thanks for stopping by
- The app is a Formative Assignment for my course at Yoobee
- As a part of this I am using github for version control
